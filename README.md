# Homework 1 Scene
 
 My scene is a custom *Star Wars* prequels battle scene featuring a few Clone Troopers and a Super Battle Droid. I included a few characters and weapons that I ripped from *Star Wars: Battlefront 2* (2017). I also found several military-esque and sci-fi assets from the Unity Asset Store. There were two major inspirations for this scene. The first was the T.V. show *The Clone Wars*, which showed several battles set in the *Star Wars* prequel era. The other inspiration was *Star Wars: Battlefront* (2015) Collections menu. This menu showed off several models from the game on a simple white background. The main character in this scene is the Clone Trooper in the back shooting at the Super Battle Droid.
